### 🎨 Beyond Research

I enjoy **photography** 📸, **hiking** 🥾, **running 5Ks** 🏃, **thriller movies** 🎬, **anime** 🎌, and **story-rich video games** 🎮 — favorites include [_L.A. Noire_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Noire) and [_Heavy Rain_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Rain). I also enjoy music 🎵 and can spend hours deep-diving into conversations about **sports**, **finance**, **history**, **politics**, and **entrepreneurship**.

I claim to know some languages — fluent in **Hindi**, **English**, **Marwari**, and **Odia**, and fluent-in-the-shower in **Japanese** 🇯🇵 and **Spanish** 🇪🇸.

### 🗺️ Geographical Journey

I was born and raised in [**Cuttack**](https://share.google/t5Ry9TdYWufxIpPTW), a historic town in [**Odisha**](https://share.google/oCfWh8Y6G0fGNOGIo) known for its silver filigree, monsoon-soaked lanes, and that one bridge you’ll always be stuck on during rush hour.

My roots? Not quite the sand dunes and camels — but close. My parents come from the **Nagaur** district of [**Rajasthan**](https://share.google/XtD3uod0zHPvA77x6), which gives me enough street cred to negotiate well, drink chai by the litre, and instinctively say _"thik hai bhai sa."_

I did my high school years in [**Kota**](https://share.google/41je8terygMzOoRyN) — yes, _that_ Kota — the city where even tea stalls offer calculus tips. The pressure cooker phase had its charm: leaking pens, 4-hour integration marathons (I love [MIT's integration bees)](https://math.mit.edu/~yyao1/integrationbee.html), and a weird fondness for 20-rupee patties.

Then came [**Chennai**](https://share.google/pufuApBKUZVL40NZq), where I spent five years at IIT Madras. I grew to love the idlis, the culture, and how the weather builds character (and occasionally melts it). On the side, I also spent a summer in [**Mumbai**](https://share.google/k3O2TB0s9KPxBgJLv) post-graduation in 2024 — the city that never sleeps… and also never slows down. I worked there as a **Data Scientist** at **Piramal Finance**, one of India’s largest lending institutions. If Mumbai taught me anything, it’s how to eat vada pav while running to catch a local.

In January 2025, I joined **Entalpic** full-time and moved to [**Bengaluru**](https://share.google/Fa7kpUFYO11JXA1sh) in September 2025 — a city where people debate batch sizes over breakfast and the startup density competes with the traffic density.

### ⚽ Sports Fandom

- **Football** ⚽: Lifelong [Chelsea FC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.) fan — through thick, thin, and transfers that made no sense. Admirer of [Joshua Kimmich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Kimmich), [Eden Hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Hazard), [Isco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isco), [Luka Modrić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri%C4%87), [Mario Mandžukić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Mand%C5%BEuki%C4%87), [Nemanja Vidić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemanja_Vidi%C4%87) and the evergreen [Thiago Silva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Silva).
- **Cricket** 🏏: [Indian Cricket Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team) all the way. [Jacques Kallis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Kallis) is a forever-favorite because balance, class, and that square cut.
- **Tennis** 🎾: [Roger Federer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer). Because some artists use brushes; he used a racquet.
