### About Me

I am a Machine Learning Research Engineer at [**Entalpic**](https://entalpic.ai/), where I work with [Victor Schmidt (CTO)](https://vict0rs.ch/) and [Alexandre Duval (CSO)](https://alexduvalinho.github.io/) on building a unified platform for materials discovery and pushing the boundaries of AI4Science to address climate change. My work involves developing **generative models** for inorganic crystal and material generation, designing **evaluation methods** and benchmarks for scientific generation tasks, and building **LLM-based agentic systems** to assist in synthesis planning and multi-modal scientific workflows.

Prior to joining Entalpic, I completed a dual degree in **Data Science** and **Biological Engineering** at the [**Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras**](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in July 2024. My thesis‚Äî**Enhancing Protein Fitness with Deep Learning**‚Äîwas co-advised by [Dr. Krishna Mahadevan (University of Toronto)](https://chem-eng.utoronto.ca/faculty-staff/faculty-members/radhakrishnan-mahadevan/) and [Dr. Nirav Bhatt (IIT Madras)](https://biotech.iitm.ac.in/innerfaculty.php?fname=Nirav%20P%20Bhatt), and was nominated for the _Best Thesis in Data Science Award_ at IIT Madras. The work was presented as a poster at [MLCB 2024](https://sites.google.com/cs.washington.edu/mlcb2024/).

In the summer of 2023, I was a research intern in [Dr. Mahadevan's lab](https://lmse.utoronto.ca/) through the [**MITACS Globalink Research Fellowship**](https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/globalink-research-internship-students/), where I focused on fine-tuning large protein language models for enzyme activity prediction. Earlier, in 2022, I interned at [Dr. David Baker‚Äôs lab](https://www.bakerlab.org/) at the University of Washington through the [**Institute for Protein Design Summer Fellowship**](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/undergraduate-research/), working on **GNNs** and **transformer architectures** for protein inverse folding.

Throughout my undergraduate years, I was actively involved in the institute‚Äôs technical community. I was part of the **Inter-IIT Tech contingent** for two years, led multiple projects with the [**Robotics Club**](https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/clubs/ibot-club) as a strategist and team lead, and contributed to the award-winning [**iGEM team**](https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/competition-teams/igem) under the guidance of [Dr. Karthik Raman](https://ramanlab.github.io/people/karthik-raman/).

### Research Interests

I am interested in using **AI to accelerate scientific discovery** ‚Äî particularly in **biological design**, **materials science**, and **drug discovery**. I‚Äôm excited about **generative modelling**, **scientific agent systems**, and building tools that improve iteration speed and steerability for experimental scientists.

I also care about **data-centric AI**, particularly in low-resource or underrepresented settings. My interests in **multilingual and multimodal NLP**, **benchmarking**, **alignment techniques**, and **evaluation methods** stem from a core belief: that impactful AI must be **reliable**, **accessible**, and **inclusive**. A significant part of my current and past work involves building or repairing datasets, identifying biases, and designing metrics that better reflect real-world generalization.

### Open Science and Community Involvement

I actively contribute to open-source and open-science efforts across several communities:

**üîπ [LeMaterial](https://lematerial.org/) (Entalpic ‚öõÔ∏è x HuggingFace ü§ó)**:

- Led the development of [**LeMat-GenBench**](https://github.com/LeMaterial/lemat-genbench) ‚Äî the first evaluation benchmark for generative models for inorganic crystals.
- Co-led [**LeMat-Synth**](https://github.com/LeMaterial/lematerial-llm-synthesis), a multimodal agentic library for extracting synthesis recipes and reaction performance data from literature and plots, resulting in a high-quality curated dataset.

**üîπ [ML Collective](https://mlcollective.org/)**:

- Worked with [Stefan Larson (Vanderbilt)](https://gxlarson.github.io/) on identifying label noise and train‚Äìtest overlaps in the RVL-CDIP dataset, and on generating realistic synthetic data for PII replacement in the IIT-CDIP corpus.
- Collaborated with [Dr. Chirag Agarwal (UVA)](https://chirag-agarwall.github.io/) and [Dr. Guadalupe Gonzalez (Genentech)](https://www.guadalupegonzalez.io/) on studying **out-of-distribution (OOD) performance** as a proxy for **explanation quality** in GNNs.

**üîπ Hugging Face Science**  
Contributing to **Deep Critical**, an agentic architecture for autonomous scientific discovery workflows.

**üîπ Cohere Labs**  
Member of the Open Science Community.
